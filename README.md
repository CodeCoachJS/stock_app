# Stock Chart

### Getting Started

---

`npm install`

`npm start`

`npm test` to run tests

---

This app makes use of `highcharts` and `alphavantage` stock API.

You will need your own API key from alphavantage to do this challenge https://www.alphavantage.co/

### TODO

---

This is app is not quite working...

Make tests pass by allowing a user to type in a search for a stock symbol. A request to the API should only be made if >= 3 letters have been typed in the search.

The search should populate a dropdown.

From the dropdown, a user can click a stock symbol which will render the chart with the daily low and high values.

### Bonus

---

This app could certainly use some styling! Add any library you feel will make this look better and any additional tests you feel are missing.

Feel free to extend functionality as well by exploring different endpoints to use or comparing companies perhaps.
